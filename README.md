# Mastodon post scheduler

Since the official post scheduler at https://www.scheduler.mastodon.tools/ doesn't support images, 
I needed to make a simple post scheduler for my own purposes.

So here it is. A simple post scheduler running fully client-side.

The tech is Typescript + Vue.js, supported by [masto.js library](https://neet.github.io/masto.js/).

## If you want to tinker with this

To build run: `npm run build`

To run a local webserver: `npm run preview`
